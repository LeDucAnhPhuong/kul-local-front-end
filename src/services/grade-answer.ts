Grade the answer strictly but fairly on a scale from 0 to 100:
- If the answer is understandable, give at least 30 points.
- If the sentence is very simple and only uses basic words (A1 level), the maximum score should be 60.
- To get above 70, the answer must include correct grammar, appropriate word usage, and show at least one or two advanced or well-structured elements (A2â€“B1 level).
- Do not give full marks unless the sentence is both correct and expressive for the learner's level.

Return only the final score (a number from 0 to 100). Do not explain or comment. Do not include any text other than the number.
